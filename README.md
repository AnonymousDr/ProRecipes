# ProRecipes
Now Open Source.  


	 * 
	 * 
	 * I have never had time to officially clean this up. That's why I decided to
	 * release it open source, for free. I don't have nearly as much time as I used to. This is for the best. Please submit code 
	 * changes + optimizations that you feel are urgent. 
	 * 
	 * Thank you to everyone who purchased ProRecipes and left kind comments in regards to it. 
	 *
	 * 
	 * 
	 * P.S. I know A LOT needs improvement. Going back I would have done many things differently (such as creating a better 
	 * project structure, or removing the massive amounts of redundancy). I made this plugin because I felt the current recipe plugins were lacking in functionality and usability. 
	 *  
	 * Feel free to make whatever changes you like (without removing functionality).
	 * 
	 * I've left the anti-piracy code commented out.
